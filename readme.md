#Replicator Queue
In this project i have tried to reproduce **_queue behaviour_** in JavaScript.


The project consist of 3 files:

* index.html
* index.js
* style.css

When you open ``index.html`` you will see how my project is executed.
**_You just need type some value in ``input`` element and press enter or click on ``green`` button_**

When you open ``style.css`` you will see some stylization code.

When you open ``index.js`` you will see main code that force this project to work
